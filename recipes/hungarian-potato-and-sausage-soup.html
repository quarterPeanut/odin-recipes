        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            When the going gets tough, the tough make soup! There are certain recipes that comfort the body and soul in a profound way and this hearty potato and sausage soup is in that class. I think you'll agree it's one of the best things you've had in a long time. The savory flavor from smoked sausage and the earthy sweetness from onions and cabbage are balanced perfectly with a splash of vinegar and a bit of sour cream, all brought together by soft and tender potatoes--the only way this gets better is serving it with a nice hunk of buttered, crusty bread.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <uo>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>6 ounces smoked Hungarian sausage, sliced into rounds</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Hungarian paprika</li>
            <li>5 cups chicken broth, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped green cabbage</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>Â½ cup sour cream, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sliced green onion, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        </uo>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a soup pot over medium heat. Add sausage and cook and stir until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove sausage to a bowl, leaving behind any butter in the pot.</li>

            <li>Toss onion into the pot with 1 teaspoon salt. Cook and stir until onion just starts to turn translucent and picks up a brown color from the meat juices in the pan, 4 to 5 minutes. Add flour; cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and paprika; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute, being careful not to burn the paprika.</li>

            <li>Stir in 5 cups chicken broth. Increase heat to high and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally so flour does not stick to the bottom of the pot. Stir in cabbage and cook until it just loses its stiffness, about 2 minutes. Stir in potatoes and bring back to a simmer. Add black pepper, cayenne pepper, and bay leaf, plus a splash of chicken broth if desired. Bring back to a simmer.</li>

            <li>Stir soup and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are very soft and tender, about 30 minutes. Add sausage and vinegar and simmer for 10 minutes. Taste and adjust for salt.</li>

            <li>Remove from heat and ladle into bowls. Garnish with sour cream, green onions, and cayenne pepper.</li>
        </ol>
